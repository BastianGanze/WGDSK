# WGDSK
Web Game Development Starter Kit

WGDSK is a boilerplate for web develeopment with Typescript.
It aims to kickstart your game development by providing all the tools you need to transpile, debug, test and create test-coverage for your game. 
It adds some utilities on its own, like an input manager, a logger, a communication service for websockets and an enhanced sprite animation class.

WGDSK is not supposed to be an engine or a framework and you can do whatever you want with it.
